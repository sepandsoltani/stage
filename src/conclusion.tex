\section*{Prospects}
This internship has given me the opportunity to better understand and build a passion for PET kinetic modelling and medical image processing.
Therefor I will be pursuing a PhD in the same laboratory (CERMEP) under the supervision of Dr. Costes and Dr. Merida after graduating from this master.
The PhD funding was secured through the The Interdisciplinary Doctoral School of Health Sciences (L'Ecole Doctorale Interdisciplinaire Sciences Sant√©-EDISS) annual PhD fellowship competition which I came joint 1st.

The PhD is titled "Multimodal PET-MR imaging: Dynamic Modelling of Neurotransmitter Release and Analysis of Neurovascular Coupling".
