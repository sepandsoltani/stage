\chapter{Conclusion}
This study demonstrates that combining TOF-MRA-guided carotid segmentation with partial volume correction in a bayesian framework improves image derived input function estimation.
While the method showed significant improvement in IDIF estimation accuracy, variability in accuracy underscores the challenges posed in artery segmentation as well as partial volume correction.
Future validation must address limitations in the current PCA framework by establishing predefined reference cohorts and expanding to multi-center studies with diverse patient populations.
By refining anatomical alignment protocols and ensuring consistent prior knowledge integration, this approach can enhance reliability for clinical translation, ultimately supporting safer, patient-friendly quantitative PET imaging.
