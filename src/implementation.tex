% \section{Implementation}
% The code was primarily implemented in Python, with some auxiliary components in Bash scripts.
% The algorithm and the intial implementation was originally developed by \citeauthor{irace2021bayesian} \cite{irace2021bayesian}.
% Building on this foundation, numerous improvements and additions were introduced to the code and the algorithm.
%
% In the original carotid segmentation algorithm, the TOF-MRA image was smoothed to reduce noise.
% The purpose of this smoothing step was to attenuate noise; however, because carotids inherently exhibit high-frequency spatial features, the smoothing inadvertently blurred these critical details, ultimately reducing the accuracy of the segmentation.
% Hence, this step was removed.
%
% In the adaptive thresholding step, all voxels, including those with zero intensity were originally included.
% This led to a significant imbalance in the intensity histograms, making the thresholding highly susceptible to variations in the number of slices and the effects of zero padding in the TOF-MRA image.
% Limiting to only nonzero voxels resulted in an immediate improvement in the final segmentation.
% Despite these improvements, some non-carotid tissues were inadvertently selected by the algorithm, hence the cuboid mask mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:carotid} was introduced.
%
% Furthermore, the code was revised to enhance both implementation and performance.
% Improvements include major bug fixes, pipeline streamlining, multi-processing support, and the integration of evaluation metrics for both individual subjects and overall dataset performance.
